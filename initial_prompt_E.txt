I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, and this is CNN.
As Israel's war in Gaza is about to enter its fifth month, the images emerging from the strip, of course, get more horrific by the day.
But it wasn't always like that.
Have a look at these photos taken in the days leading up to September, October 7, by a Palestinian photographer who wanted to capture the beauty of Gaza.
But, of course, he soon found himself documenting carnage and destruction instead.
After more than 100 days of tireless and distressing work, Aziza and his family evacuated to Qatar.
He spoke to CNN's Becky Anderson about the toll the war has taken on him, warning some of the images.
These images, you'll see, are graphic and disturbing.
On the first day, from the early morning, I woke up, like, with a shock, what is happening?
A lot of rockets, and the sky, a lot of explosions.
And so I took my camera.
